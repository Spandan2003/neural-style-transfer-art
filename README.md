# Neural Style Art Transfer
<p> VanGoghAI is an artificial intelligence model that learns from visual data to produce stunning pieces of art on its own. It trains itself using paintings and art styles and creates a completely new canvas that emulates the style and manner of what it has been trained upon. It utilizes fundamental ideas of machine learning, image processing and neural networks to accomplish this. After forming an initial draft, it continues to improve and fine-tune the picture using feedback algorithms until it is sufficiently happy with the degree of perfection it has achieved, and in the matter of some pixels and a few moments, we have a beautiful AI generated canvas, ready for display in the countryâ€™s most elite museums. Additionally, you might find that for a particular content some styles suit it very well. In our last phase, we aim to implement an automatic style determiner. This would just require us to give a content image and it would do the rest on its own. </p>
<p> There are two Jupyter Notebooks present. The "basic.ipynb" file gives you an awesome image generated by combination of two images which you give. The "silhouette.ipynb" file on the other hand combines a silhoutte with a style to create amazing logos.</p>
